				<h1>About Me</h1>

				<img src="assets/images/kelly.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Kelly Mersereau">

				<p> I graduated from Seton Hall University in 2011 with a BA in Public Relations.  Since graduating I've been working in the field of Human Resources.  I started as a Human Resources Generalist and now I work as a Benefits Analyst.  I've always had an interest in learning more about developing websites.  I started teaching myself HTML and CSS a few years ago, but I found it difficult to know what other languages I should learn without any guidance.  I decided to make 2016 the year of Kelly.  After years of trying to learn web development, I decided this was the year to throw myself into learning and do everything possible to change the course of my career, and that's how I ended up at Rutger's Coding Bootcamp.</p>

				<p> Just a little more about me as a person.  I am a problem solver, an outside the box thinker, an avid learner, an extremely hard worker.  I have an insatiable drive to learn, so I walk around soaking up every piece information I can get my hands on.  Music is the single most important thing in my life.  I spend my time going to concerts, festivals, taking road trips, collecting vinyl, snuggling with my cats, and exploring everything around me.  </p>
